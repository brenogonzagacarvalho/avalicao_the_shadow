The only sad part is that I really wanted to play more, the game is a little short. That being said the game is really creative and unlike anything i've seen before (pun intended) and  I highly recommend it if you like great stories and trying out new things.",TRUE,2,2022-01-02 02:24:12

14252,english,"I purchased this game for my blind daughter to try.  It's very difficult to find audio based games for her, and she is tremendously jealous of her sighted brother as he loves to play video games (as I do!).  I loaded up the game for her, and let her play.  It is 100% accessible from the first menu through the end of the game.  She was completely engaged in both the story and gameplay, and didn't want to stop playing.  Between play sessions, she told us about the characters and what was going on, and she was excited about it.  It took her 8 hours of game time to complete the game, and I'm sure she will go through it again, as she didn't want it to end.  Thanks to the developers for the quality experience, and I hope you think about a sequel or more games like this one!",TRUE,691,2022-05-24 02:50:24

15,english,"[b]First: [/b]
Play with a good headset and close your eyes. The immersion and game experience will be far better than with open eyes and normal loudspeakers.

[b]Now to the game itself:[/b]
This is a very unique game, since you experience the whole game from the eyes of a blind woman, meaning you won't see anything. So you will rely on your hearing and orientate and fight through audio cues. The cast delivers an awesome job in bringing the characters to life and I always wanted to know how the story continues. While this game won't be for everyone, I had 6 hours of fun (time didnt count in steam somehow) and can attest, that not only blind gamers will like this one.

For the negative points: I played the game in 30 minutes bursts, because after that time I had to pause. I'm not used to keeping my eyes closed all the time and the additional mental load on my brain for navigating all the time just by ears was tiring me. As a seeing person, I also had bigger problems of navigating by ear and making a mental map of the areas. I nearly always just walked directly towards the audio source, but couldn`t  learn the layout of the areas. But those points didn`t diminish the fun I had, so I would advice you to try this game out. If it's not for you, you can always return it.",TRUE,39,2022-04-25 17:54:25
575,english,"It’s like Kingdom Come Deliverance if Henry was blind.

I like to think that behind the black screen and floating dots, there's actually an in-game engine with amazing graphics

This is one of the best video games I've ever played, and I finished it with my eyes closed. The Vale is an audio-based game that is best played with headphones. The only graphics are floating colored spheres that don't help you so you might as well just close your eyes. But this is not just a glorified audio book. It's an actual game. 

The game uses audio cues and directional sound to direct you to attack and block in one of three directions. It sounds simple but the combat actually gets more complex as it unfolds with hunting with bows and arrow, a little magic, parrying, heavy attacks, interrupting attacks, etc. It was just so cool to close your eyes and listen to the direction of the enemies and block and attack. It was so incredibly unique. The audio aspect gave me some Hellblade vibes.  I chose to play on the hardest difficulty. It was challenging at times but totally fair and it made the combat and the game even more immersive.

You play as a blind female protagonist who is led by a guide in a fantasy realm where enemies are after her. The devs created an incredible female protagonist and it was really cool to have no video as it put you in the shoes of the protagonist as she is blind and can only respond to the sounds of her environment as well. It was a massive step up in terms of immersion. 

The main story and voice acting were really high quality and I really enjoyed how it all unfolded at the end. The entirely verbal story felt surprisingly intimate. It was an all-around beautiful experience. There are even side quests in the game that had a unique way of being unlocked and played. You follow sounds in a town square, are prompted later to press a button to start the quest, and then you travel to a self contained area to complete the quest. 

You might be traveling and come across an inn with shops nearby. You’ll hear the sound of sword smiths working on swords, the banging of steel. Walk towards that if you wanna buy and sell gear there. You might hear chickens in the distance which will tell you it’s a spot you can buy food and stuff. You can go inside inns and take on side quests. I had one quest where you had to find treasure behind a waterfall. Well you and your companion search for said waterfall and you’ll hear it in the distance. 

The game is also fully accessible to visually impaired as all the menus are voiced like the inventory menu. It's a pretty great thing that someone who is visually impaired cannot only relate to the protagonist but can also fully play a video game.

I feel like a lot of people write it off pretty quick because you’re blind in game and see nothing, but it’s so much more than that. The story is good. It’s an RPG at heart. The combat is actually engaging and makes you focus and listen carefully. I never had a game tell you and show you so much without having anything on screen. 

It was such a unique experience to, well, experience something simply by only sounds. I had to pay attention to the things I would normally not even notice consciously.  It was definitely weird at first, I was totally looking for visualy but got used to it after a bit. I loved the ending too, I somehow did not expect that. 

I have to say, that even despite the negatives and the drawbacks outlined by some, I think this game deserves a standing ovation for really trying something new and being very innovative, and I sincerely hope more of this type of thing becomes a thing. While I'm not blind, nor do I know anyone who is (that would be likely to play video games), I just love that this was made.

Don't let this gem pass you by. It's an incredibly unique twist on video games the likes you’ve probably never experienced before. Probably the easiest 10 I have ever given because it was so unique and immersive.

Seeing the average reviews on by people who never gave it a chance though, no wonder the triple A gaming industry is in such a sh*t place right now. For these people if it isn't the new yearly Call of Duty or FIFA shovelware, it's trash.

1495,english,"Definitely play with headphones.

I use corrective lenses, contacts and glasses.  When I take them off, I cannot see any words on my computer screen, have limited depth perception, and cannot tell objects apart unless their colours are dynamically distinct from their surroundings, I played and streamed a bit of this without any corrective lenses and it felt absolutely wonderful.  Worn glasses since 8 years old with gradually deteriorating eyesight ever since.  So corrective lenses have always been my normal, but when I played this game, even streamed it, I was comfortable and entirely engaged.  Even the little ""stars"" (just dots but to me they looked like stars) of colours that I could see without my lenses were a pleasant touch because they gave me to option to see something if I wanted to.  To rely on hearing more was so satisfying for the combat and is an aspect that is easy to take for granted in just about every other game.  I remember telling my friend when he was playing a jump rope challenge FFIX to closes his eyes and listen for the sound cue because that would be more accurate than his vision.  We enjoy sound in stereo for movies and audio books and tv shows, why not for games too?  

The story is very engaging and the voice actors they found for it we very well done.  I forgot I was streaming while I played this game. Even the voice for the menu screens was pleasant and didn't sound out of place with the dynamic of the story so I could remain in the story world even when I had to bring up stats menu or main menu screens.

I was not expecting the quests I got.  It made the world in which the story takes place come alive as not all of them are part of the main story.  It would have been just fine if the developers just made a story and had you just play that as a nice adventure tale.  But they took time to make a world with people who have wants, needs, greed, desires, all walks of life and the actors add many details that helped all of that build and come together in my mind's eye.

What's the most satisfying feeling for me, though? I get sick usually playing first person games.  The camera motions make me queasy.  This is the first game I have been able to say I can play first person. And honestly, that's enough to make me cry for joy.

So, yes, get this game, Try this game...but most of all, tell people that this game and this developer exists.",TRUE,43,2021-09-30 17:23:59
848,english,"This graphics-less “audio game” works pretty intuitively, and it's deeper than I initially expected. It plays like Punch-Out with stealth and RPG elements. Some combat functions are finicky--blocking, even when inputted early, often lets the first attack of a combo go through, and hunting with a bow demands more precision than I can personally manage with audio alone. But blind combat is otherwise a satisfying (and steep) challenge.

The real star of the show is the dialogue, which feels surprisingly organic and intimate. Tightly written, beautifully voice acted, and weaved into the mechanics, it fits the game like a glove. I don't want to spoil anything other than the fact that the dialogue caught me off-guard.

I love medieval fantasy settings and character-driven stories. The Vale offers both in a way I’ve never seen before. It’s weird, it’s different, and it’s unforgettable. My experience playing The Vale was novel not just because it lacked visuals but also because its characters were intensely human. I highly recommend this game.",TRUE,31,2023-07-07 03:20:18
314,english,"After finishing this game I felt compelled to write a review.

Have you ever wondered what it would be like being blind? What it truly entails? This game gives you a glimpse in what life would be like being blind. The concept is unique; You play as a blind woman traversing a medieval world. As you are playing a blind woman, you literally stare at a black screen (with coloured lights to reflect the type of environment that you are in) for a few hours.

The feat accomplished here is not small; the players engagement entirely depends on the voice acting, and the story being told. The vale does this masterfully. 

The vale has an incredible sound design, which makes you feel immersed in the world that it is presenting itself to you. The game made it a point to make sure the player understands that while being blind is limiting, you are in no way helpless. Everyone relies on somebody, and this is no different in the game.

Movement relies on the sound stage (hence the recommendation of headphones). You navigate the world purely based on sound. This can be a fun, but also perhaps a terrifying experience. Since you have no visual on anything, you literally only have sound to go by. This is also reflected by the main characters state when things unbeknownst to her are happening; she can only infer based on sound. This also applies to the combat in the game. Based on directional sound, the player needs to either block or attack at the right time based on sound cues. This makes for a very fun (albeit sometimes hard) experience to survive combat encounters (based on the difficulty setting).

I really recommend you try out this game, its an experiance in and of itself.

383,english,"The Vale caught my interest as it is a completely audio-based game, something I have never encountered thus far.

It's comparable to an audio drama, expect for the added agency you have via the gameplay, which is surprisingly fun with various elements that switch it up every now and then. It, together with the excellent sound design and voice acting, made for an immersive, unique experience I would very much like to see more developers test around with. The in-game menus can be navigated by audio only, but are of course also visible. Headphones are a must as you need to differentiate between the directions sounds are coming from in combat.

The only thing I would have liked is just... more. I loved Alex's story, the people she met along the way, as well as the RPG mechanics. But it really is quite short, so be aware of that. 

To conclude, I'm glad I stumbled upon this game and I hope other developers pick up on its ideas and the potential it has, for accessibility's sake and for pushing the medium itself.",TRUE,25,2021-11-30 23:47:50

467,english,"It's difficult to explain in words just how special this game is, but I can try.

The Vale is, quite simply, marvelous. In this game, you play as a blind princess in a medieval fantasy world filled with monsters, bandits, and soldiers trying to kill you. Yes, this game is designed to be played without vision, but make no mistake, that's not a gimmick here. This is a full, complete game, with a rich world, RPG elements, side quests, branching paths, moral choices, the works. If anything, removing the visuals opens up an entirely new style of play that I've never had the chance to experience before. You are listening for every footstep and sword swing, using your ears to guide you through the experience. It's intensely gratifying and rewarding, and it's backed up by the best sound design in the business. The Vale places you into a vivid and lush world, and because you need to really focus on hearing everything around you, it feels like you're really there. It says something that the most immersive game I've played in years has no visuals.

The Vale includes a surprisingly complex combat system, with enough depth and choice to satisfy a wide variety of playstyles. Stealth and ranged combat are both options, as well as magic, and different methods of hand-to-hand combat. Throw in a few incredible boss fights and a bunch of different enemy types, each with their own attack pattern, and you got a recipe that will please any fan of action.

Of course, the real highlight in my mind is the story. All the characters here are wonderfully fleshed out, carried by some spectacular voice acting and great chemistry. The plot is filled with enough intrigue and twists to keep me not only interested but invested. I admit, there were a handful of moments where I did tear up a bit. And, not to get into spoilers, but The Vale sticks the landing with a satisfying ending.

If you're put off by the concept of playing an action RPG with no visuals, trust me, you do not want to miss this. Rather than detracting, it adds an entirely new dimension to a formula that had been getting stale for some time. The Vale is the kind of game that sticks with you long after you're done with it. If anything, it's worth it just to support a developer doing great work on making games accessible. Go on this journey. You won't come out the same way.

Oh, and it should go without saying, but you're gonna want a good pair of headphones for this one.",TRUE,22,2021-12-22 03:24:10
132,english,"Saw this game promoted on Axios, really liked the idea of playing as a blind hero. Have been playing for an hour and a half and combat is a lot more interesting than I thought.

324,english,"A classic well-written story about a blind princess' journey through a country under invasion.

This is a game that is played by following the sound queues, it is fully sound-based and everything is voiced, all the menus and options included. Fully accessible for people with visual impairments and is a worthy experience for anybody else.

The sound engine is quite simplistic, especially compared to other games with strong superiour sound work (example - Hunt: Showdown), but it is serviceable.

So is combat - serviceable. Enemies attack from three sides with audio cues (some of them are harder to decode than others), each enemy type has different patterns of attacks (there are 5 types of enemies, some vary their patterns, some have a gimmick). You have 2 types of attacks, directional block, stamina management (no stam bar) and a couple of extra abilities. 

The voice work is well-produced and well-written, despite the fantasy tropes, The music is ok, so are the visuals - you get some if you wanna look at your screen.

The whole game can be completed in about 5 hours.

While being nothing special as a fighting marvel, it is a game that tries and, in my opinion, prevails at a goal of making a uniquely accessible game. Considering it's made by a small team, The Vale is a gem of a journey.

Worth buying, playing and supporting.",TRUE,25,2022-02-13 10:14:51

The battle system is creative with different strategies you can use, reacting to the acustic clues the enemies make. The quest system is nicely solved by entering a tavern, navigating through available quests and instantly teleporting to the place where you need to be.

466,english,"I live in the dark... 
I can relate to the character in this game, and she, definitely could relate to me. 

I remember playing, the blue jar, and the papa sangre series and the blind legend. I love these games. They give me the freedom to do, the seemingly impossible. 

I know everyone's review review of this game, comes from a place, based on their own life and experience. I would like to share mine... 

Firstly... To play this game, I used a set of audio-Technica over the ear monitors. 

I play the entire game, in two settings, on the steam deck.

I did not feel like the game was too short, or too long. 

The characters in The game, where tangibly real. Human... 

When I started this game, I had no expectations. I simply enjoyed the game, as it was. I am not going to compare it with anything, as I truly believe that a game, is its own thing. It's own world, with its own story to tell. 

This is a linear experience. I believe this is absolutely fine, especially for the first of it series. I truly have no reason to believe, that's something like this could not evolve into an absolute open world game. I also believe, given the controls, along without a accused and things based on other games, that this would not be a problem to navigate. There are, after all, RPGs in development, made for those that cannot see. 

I love the sound stage. Though I believe this game was not made with special audio in mind, the stereo implementation, is nevertheless, effective. 

I loved all the submissions, though I wish there were more of them. More gear, more characters. More everything. No it isn't to say that this game is lacking. 

As a whole, I absolutely loved the experience. The games controls are logical and easy to use., The game is emotionally available and offers a variety of choices, based on the kind of person you are. Play your way. 

When the game is over, I find myself wondering what all of the characters are doing now? Hoping they are okay, wondering what adventures are yet to come? Well I hear from my friends again..? 

A world has been built here, and I sank myself into it. 

My home, is that it is only the beginning. 

A game made for me, to play in a world, that wasn't made for me... 

We need more games like this. 

Just because you perhaps, are not visually impaired or blind, doesn't necessarily mean that you will not enjoy this game. 

If playing a game, is all about new experiences, then why not give it a try. Learn to live another way. Learn to play, another way. Those people that you perhaps think, are significantly limited because they cannot see, perhaps, this may change your perspective. 

Thank you to the developers and all those involved that came together to create something beautiful. 
Something very special.

Sit back. Close your eyes and see... 
I think you will find, that this game, has some of the very best graphics, that you will ever see in your lifetime. 

You get, what you give.

 If you have an especially incredible imagination, then you are in for an outstanding experience.

I am very much looking forward to the next time the fallen squirrel plummets from a tree near me.
I promise... I will be right there to catch you. 

With the the utmost respect and a heart full of gratitude.

It even seems like background noise is pretty minimal early on, but as you get used to the game, picks up a bit. So even just hearing the right thing is a challenge that levels up as you go.

I can't confirm what the few negative reviews I saw here said. 
I try to give my thoughts on the points those brought up. It is part of the Story to lose sometimes, don't be deterred by that. Someone criticized that you can't set different sound levels for SFX/Dialog/etc. - imho that is not a flaw, that is done on purpose because the mixture of different sounds is an important gameplay element. Someone said in combat gameplay is a mess and I disagree strongly - yes it gets confusing at times and that is what it should be or better has to be. You need to learn to listen properly first, then you can get good at combat in this game. You are supposed to be disoriented in some situations - you are playing as a blind person afterall and that is part of the experience.

Listening to dialogs without having any text support always led me to fatigue and miscomprehension. This is the same here.
It seems like a very interesting experience, but as I played the few first minutes of the game, i'm not sure i can say how many different people talked, nor who they are despite some titles and links were dropped.

What i understood was that there was someone (who smell very bad) that i needed to punish for leaving some king near a cliff while playing a game of some sort. Based on description and reviews, i'm far enough from the real plot to not wanting to go back to that game.

Subtitles would greatly help, but doesn't exists.

Note that, if you are fluent, it shouldn't be hard, so you should definitively try that game. I'm just bad at understanding voices.

To back this opinion let me bring up some statistics: ~80% of people have killed the first enemy, ~50% have completed the first side quest, ~25% have completely finished the tutorial, and only ~15% have beaten the game. Considering the game's rather short - 6-10 hours - that's a pretty rapid dropoff rate, don't you think? 

Oh, but you could say that this is because playing as a blind person is probably not very fun for most people. That might be true, and indeed, it could be the reason for those low stats. To me, however, playing while blind was actually by far the best part of the game. I even played blindfolded, so that my brain would completely shut off the ""seeing"" functionality. Having my mind construct the world purely on the soundscape and how it changes was [strike]eye opening[/strike] quite something.

[h1]The Gameplay: Combat[/h1]
So how does it play? During fighting, you press arrow keys to attack an enemy that is standing in a given direction. Which direction? Use your ears. The enemy might block, so it's possible you'll have to attack when they're getting ready to strike themselves. Or block and counter. Sometimes you'll even have to face multiple enemies at once; headphones absolutely necessary.

Now that sounds pretty sweet, doesn't it? That's the thing. It gets boring pretty fast.

And this is arguably the biggest issue with the game. You fight quite a bit, and yet fighting simply doesn't feel good. I mean; I can confidently say the devs juiced it up as much as possible. The slash sounds, the footsteps, the grunts and screams, all top notch. But I feel like the format itself is just... not that fun. 

[h1]The Gameplay: Other[/h1]
You also get to walk around a bit. That's much more interesting, having to navigate purely based on sound. It's a lot more fun than it sounds, and noticing the sounds spicing up your idea of the world is also quite amazing. Sadly, again: once the novelty runs out it just becomes... flat.

There's also some system of managing weapons and inventory. Navigating the menus is not fun as well, probably because you have to hear the explanation of what options are there and how to choose between them. I feel like this part could've been done better, but how? Using shortcuts maybe? 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I'm not going to lie, I wouldn't know how to make a good game in which you can't see a thing. This is definitely a noble attempt, and we need more of those - if nothing else, so that one eventually gets it right and creates a completely new way to include lots of previously excluded people in the world of video games.

All my complaints... for blind people this is probably normal, in which case I'm really sorry. I'll never take my sight for granted, and I hope that one day technology allows you to perceive the world the way we, seeing folk, do. Or at least to give us a game that both groups of people can enjoy just the same. This one is probably not it, even if it's arguably worth playing just to understand how the world looks like to those who can't see.

Playing as the blind Princess Alex, you are desperate to get to safety. The only handicap is that you can not see anything and must rely on your hearing to see you to safety.

As a sighted person, I also loved the empathy generated by the blind perspective of the main character, and how much agency she has. Hey dev team: I beg of you, please make a sequel or ten.",TRUE,10,2022-03-10 23:28:06
617,english,"An incredible experience, with no visuals throughout aside from the necessary menus, which are all beautifully narrated, and the wonderfully done visual ambience that works both as a way to orient ones self for those who can see, but also add to the environment, by falling like rain or snow, or rising like embers. 

Yet despite the lack of more complex visuals, I don't think the game loses a single thing compared to even large titles. The story and world are deeply immersive in a way that's incredibly unique, that may be even more immersive than the most polished visuals, as it makes you see the world in your mind. That alone to me feels worthwhile, even if just for the new focus on a sense considered secondary for most people. 

The game-play itself is intuitive and enjoyable, simple at its core, yet provides a challenge, and takes both focus and practice to master. It is truly unlike any other game I've played in the most amazing way. The story itself isn't long, even with all the side quests along the way, but it is packed with emotional moments, wonder, and good twists that only serve to deepen the story. It's, some of the most incredible representation, both for the disabled community, as well as women in both a form of media, and in a genre that sorely lacks stories focused on women as people.

I look forward to future works in this style, especially if its more in this world that they created, and just like the hero of its story, this game can take on giants, despite its, or rather, because of its differences.",TRUE,6,2023-07-17 13:51:59
551,english,"At the very least I have to recommend this as I'm not sure I've played anything like it, nor do I expect to again in the future. It's not some exceptional experience that is above all games or something. It's an intimate leap into bounds of the lives of other real people, and done tastefully so.

When I got The Vale I thought it would be just a novelty accessibility game for the blind. It certainly fits that category, but I got a little more than that. I am sighted, so I used a blindfold/darkness and played with a keyboard and mouse. Surround sound headphones are pretty much obligatory, since essentially every gimmick relies on your ability to detect the directions of sounds in the environment and combat.

You play a blind princess in a medieval setting. Most of this is pretty cliche, but some characters add some personality to pull you along the narrative enough to stay interested. Being purely audio, the voice acting and music is pretty good, as you could expect. I also felt like the directional aspects of the surround sound were very accurate and played well to the main designs around this concept.

I do think that the plot thickens and twists near its abrupt end, which is a shame. It took me around 10 hours to complete, but it felt like it could have been summed up better in another hour or two of more deliberately unraveling some of the story's complexities instead of oversimplifying its resolution.  

The game follows a pattern where you go from destination to destination as a ""base"" in which you find a few quests/town interactions where you must rely on sound to avoid hazards and attack/defend in combat. You get a bow, heavy or light weapon, armor, and shield to upgrade over time in a linear fashion. I don't see why someone would play and not do all of the few quests in each town, so you're never out of money and there is not much choice there. This system could have been expanded slightly, I think. You also gain an ability later on that can affect different aspects of combat that has different ways of being upgraded, as well as forks in the story that you do choose to change, albeit with the same ultimate destination.

The uniqueness of gameplay of The Vale is enough to try, and its quality for being developed by such a small group is admirable and impressive. I definitely recommend it for any PC gamer who wants something different, and, of course, for those without sight, I cannot speak to how this experience would be for them, but I think it would still be fun and challenging.",TRUE,8,2023-11-26 06:00:24

Full text to speech in all the menus was a welcome feature and one that I greatly appreciate the devs thinking of. 

The audioscapes are great, with excellent sound design and just the right amount of challenge to keep me forging ahead through the captivating storyline. Combat is easy to pick up with several tutorials at different points in the story. There was never a point where I felt overwhelmed with the different audio cues, although the difficulty does climb gradually as you learn to navigate your way through increasingly complex environments and battles. Alex is a fantastic protagonist and at no point in the story does she ever feel anything less than a capable, independent badass.

There are branching paths, which also function as optional difficulty spikes. There's a large ambush that you aren't meant to survive, but you can defeat it if you really want to. You are just about able to do it, as long as you don't make more than 2 mistakes.

299,english,"The Vale could quite conceivably be played with your monitor turned off as every element of the menus and interface is spoken along with clear instructions of what buttons you should be pressing.  But an accessible UI is just the beginning.  How do you make a 5+ hour adventure/RPG engaging and entertaining with absolutely no conventional graphics?  It’s well known that when one of your senses stops functioning the others will compensate, and in this case it’s all about the audio.

So the game starts off with you, a young girl, traveling by wagon to your new castle on the outskirts of a kingdom now under rule by your brother, the new king.  Blinded at birth, you can only hear the creaking of the wagon and the plodding of hooves until your wagon is stopped by a guard who says they are under attack from an invading army and you should flee at once.  Again, everything is voice and sound effects only with nothing more than dust motes swirling around the screen; purely artistic with no relevance to the actual game, nothing to give sighted gamers an unfair advantage.

From this moment you are on your own as you must complete the long and perilous journey home through the winding valley known as The Vale.  In true RPG fashion you’ll need to equip yourself with a weapon; a variety of weapons in fact along with magical abilities and the occasional companion to aid you on several quests while always relying on your most powerful ability…your hearing.  Your ability to identify and locate danger through audio alone is something quite unique.  Hearing a growling wolf is one thing but listening to the subtle changes in that growl to nail the perfect timing of your attack is another.  At first you’ll likely being swinging your stick around wildly, much like any newly blind person would, but once you settle down and learn to listen you can actually start to enjoy the engaging combat system that will slowly rise in difficulty as you learn to mix light and heavy attacks with perfectly timed counters and even learn to fire a bow.  You’ll eventually face off against multiple enemies at once, learn to listen for archery fire, and even traverse some surprisingly terrifying stealth sections.  The sinister audio in these moments really sparks the darkest parts of your imagination.

My favourite aspect of The Vale is the character, story and voice acting. Character personality is portrayed perfectly through voice acting and it is very easy to imagine what they may look like. Dialogue is organic and engaging. I really enjoyed the characters' journey

Played with xbox one controller for PC. Avoids X/Y/A/B buttons, Right and left triggers are used as accept and decline in menus, left and right stick are used for movement and look direction during locomotion and shield and sword during combat respectively. 

3 difficulties (casual, normal, hard). Bosses can be deceptively difficult and combat is very aurally engaging. Highly recommended to play with headphones.

798,english,"Introduction
The Vale is not long and some may find the gameplay simple, but it’s enjoyable with fantastic sound and a solid story. 
Story
You are a blind princess. At the game’s start, you’re on your way to take residence in a frontier castle. And then the Vale’s Golden Horde equivalent arrive and ruin your day. Now you’re retracing your journey to bring word to your brother. 
It’s a pretty straightforward start, but there are some twists later. Hopefully at least one of them will come as a surprise.
Gameplay
The Vale is an audio game, so there are no visuals. You alternate between free-roam and combat mode.
Free-roam is much like any first person game. Moving around, interacting with things, and talking with people. You’ll need to use audio to guide yourself though. 
In combat, you’re locked in place. Attacks come from left, right, or ahead. You’re basically engaged in a series of quick time events, listening for attacks to know when and in what direction to raise your shield and then strike back. 
As with other action RPG games, you’ll be able to acquire new equipment as the game progresses. These items are armour (take less damage when you do get hit), shields (block stronger blows), bows (used in certain sequences), and weapons (you can use swords, hammers, or axes). 
You’ll also pick up some magical abilities later, which are used in combat.
I found the gameplay satisfying. The gear upgrades felt like I was improving. Each weapon type also felt slightly different. There’s also bonus points for everyone’s favourite early quest: killing rats in the cellar.
Audio
The game’s big draw. All the audio is fantastic. The voice acting is great, combat sounds satisfying, and environment noises solid. 
Particular highlights are the alehouse scene with all the patrons singing together and the battle scene later in the game. In fact, that battle scene is the most immersed I’ve ever felt in a video-game combat experience. It’s all thanks to the audio.
Conclusion
The Vale isn’t long, perhaps 5-6 hours for a single playthrough. I enjoyed every minute of it though. It’s a great little game and I hope the developers go on to build on it in the future. Perhaps next time we can even get that other most coveted RPG trope: the sewer level.

Interesting story up until the very end of gameplay. Afterwards there's some more dialogue that kinda makes the ending feel like a wimper. It's still great despite that blunder at the very end.

Surprisingly compelling gameplay for the first half, gets repetitive afterwards but there's still some nuance and player input that can shake things up quite a bit.

The combat is spoiled to be on the easier side, only following audio clues. But nonetheless still an experience. You can definitely feel the weight of your swings and hits you scored.

There is a bow in this game, and honestly I've used it to farm alot of copper hunting. But I can see that it may be one of the most frustrating things to use in the game. But if you've learned much from the audio clues, it's actually easier.

Maybe the one other way to improve on the game, is somewhat allow a sort of VR headset that tracks the head's movement. As I repeated turn my head to the sideways often to follow a sound, only to find that it's frustrating that it doesn't change like in real life. ;( 

10/10 would go for sequel.",TRUE,2,2022-01-23 15:37:26

Its core gameplay mechanics, Combat and Hunting are really well done and, what surprised me the most, varied. There are a few different kinds of enemies and fighting each of them feels unique.

393,english,"The Vale is a very high quality audio based action-adventure game which I consider as my favorite game of 2021. It features intuitive tense gameplay, well done soundscapes and voice work, and a few quite impressive set piece moments communicated beautifully with little more than audio. If you want to experience a great game that may expand your horizons as to what can be done in the medium of videogames then you should try The Vale: Shadow of the Crown.

34,english,"I love games or even things in general that surprise me. That show me something that I did not know/experience.
This game definitively has. As of now to my knowledge it is one of a kind. And I am glad for the experience so far.

It has the core ingredients for a wonderful game:
- Something unique and new
- Solid execution
- Splendid voice acting
- Sublime story line
- Sophisticated Characters

And before I go overboard with the s-es. Let me say the game is stellar and I highly recommend it.",TRUE,2,2022-08-06 19:50:20
481,english,"Pros:
I loved the game.
It's an experience of you being in a story with some lovable characters.
There was a decent amount of lore that was hinted at. You don't know exactly why everything happened at the end of the game, but in a way that makes you want a sequel. 
The combat mechanic was fun and a good challenge at times.
When you fail in combat, it fits the story and doesn't feel like your trying the same level over and over again.
It hit me in the feels a couple of times. 

Here are the cons I can think of:
I wasn't a huge fan of using the bow. It seemed a bit unpolished, but it's not too important to the game.
No chapter select feature. This makes it really time consuming if you want to go back for achievements because you have to do another play-through.
Most choices in the game were ""do this or don't do this."" You don't get a lot of freedom to define your character. I would have loved to see the ability for your character to choose how she ends the story, but you just get a brief ""This is how it happened"" at the end. But again, this is part of the idea that you're a character living in a story.

Its really impressive that a game that's not long (about 8 hours for me) can give a full RPG experience with meaningful options on how to build your character, interesting and varied side quests, a host of characters that seem real and a story that draws you in.  Its exactly the kind of experience I look for in games.  Oh, and, to boot, a completely novel (to me) experience because its audio only. That part makes you really listen and pay attention.  You won't win this one in a click-fest.  Two thumbs up from me.

There were a few fights I had trouble with so maybe 3 times in the game I switched to casual mode.

393,english,"Amazing game from beginning to the end. Highly recommend playing the whole game with your eyes closed. I first saw this game during the demos and loved the concept, and having finished the game I can the mechanics of having a sound only game is amazing. Though the mechanics are simpler than other sword fighting games, the fact that you have to listen to subtle sounds of armor shifting to track enemies and react in a melee where the chaos of battle in the background is a real problem. The entire experience makes the fights more intimate, you are listening to clues to see how the fight is going (damaged enemies make more pained sounds when attacking, and fresh enemies taunt you when you flail wildly). I would love to see this expanded even further since there could be so much more that can be done with an audio only combat system.
In terms of story, the overall journey is pretty similar to other hero's quests, the underlying story of some otherworldly influence does add a layer of complexity. I think the story is carried by the supreme voice acting of the main characters, especially the lead. Towards the end of the 3rd act, I felt more invested in these people more than any story from Scrolls series.",TRUE,5,2022-04-13 02:33:02

436,english,"I'm a sighted person and got bored of the usual visual games. I've tried every imaginable genre, VR games as well as non-VR, text based games as well as more immersive graphical ones. I thought nothing in the gaming world could surprise. Until I heard about the Vale and decided to give it a try. I was blown away. I find it such a rewarding challenge to rely on hearing instead of vision to navigate a gaming. I was afraid that as a sighted person who relies on vision too much it would be overwhelming, but I found it surprisingly simple and intuitive. The devs did a really good job with the sound design that closely mimics real life experience. And the ambient sounds and immersive feel of it all just blew me away.

Definitely play this with headphones. Also if you are sighted consider using a blindfold. There are minimalist graphics- little dots that shift left or right to show you which way you are turning or turn blue during the nighttime, also a convenient map of the world you are exploring- but they aren't important. You'll want to concentrate on what you are hearing as much as you can and to do that it is best if you are blindfolded. 

The story is compelling. The voice acting is phenomenal. And the sound design is pretty out of this world. The combat is a lot of fun and progressively gets more challenging. And there's tons of stuff to do with all kinds of quests to do to earn coin and upgrade your gear.

Playing this games is like reading a book: your minds fills in all the blanks and creates and colors the world you are experiencing through your hearing. Since most games- with all their visuals- rarely leave anything to your imagination, this game is a refreshing change of pace and reminds me of my childhood when I skipped school just to read the latest Harry Potter book, mind full with students in cloaks cursing each other and zooming around on broomsticks.

This game is a truly unique experience and has gotten me excited for a new gaming experience for the first time in a while. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a unique, compelling challenge.",TRUE,2,2021-08-23 20:04:00

I will say, I do wish a few of the audio cues for attacks were a little more distinguished to better paint a picture of what was going on, but it was a great experience nonetheless. There's partical effects to help orient yourself for those too attached to visuals to function. But, you don't need those by any means to play through the whole game. In fact, I deliberately blindfolded myself to give it that extra realism. Once you get the combat figured out, you'll start to feel like a badass.

Pros:
[olist]
[*] Completely blind accessible
[*] Audio and voice acting is phenomenal
[*] Inclusion: as an Arab I was pleasantly surprised that they included Arabic voice actors
[*] around 7 hours of great story with a room for sequel should the devs create one down the line (the game itself has a decent ending too, it doesn't end on a cliffhanger or anything like that) 
[/olist]

Cons:
[olist]
[*] In certain fights like the one with [spoiler]the Baker[/spoiler] the audio gets too complicated. There are VFX sounds, yelling sounds, grunting sounds, shouting sounds all on top of the normal fight sounds which makes things too tough to follow. I'm still convinced that I won that one by sheer luck (I play on medium difficulty).
Side note: This could have been intentional by the devs, but as a player I just found it hard to concentrate with all that going on at once.
[*] The  [spoiler]Honey Gathering[/spoiler] quest is hard to follow as well.
[*] The city layouts are a bit tough to navigate, I just walk in the general direction of the sounds and hope to reach where I want.

Really engaging. Other missions include navigating mazes of different sorts with deadly hazards. Hearing gravel fall as you near a precipice is amazing when you can't see and actually fear for your character.

The voice acting and story is very well done. It is for the most part scripted. The only thing I would say this game could do better was light attacks while blocking and just more game. There is a combat ring event side quest. I would have liked it more developed as well as the hunting one. My favorite battle was a melee ranged exchange with a rival seer.

Would love to see a continuation, either in some neighbouring genre or with more depth/variety to the gameplay.

This game could use just a bit more polish however, for example:
1. No support for multiple saves. You can't really ""die"" in this game, but trying out different plot paths is difficult.
2. Unskippable plot scenes. While technically there is some replayability, I would imagine sitting through every dialogue (as great as they are) just to try a different choice two thirds into the game will get old pretty fast.

450,english,"The Vale is a bit of a rough gem, but fortunately it's worth is greater than the sum of its parts.

First off, this game is a pretty novel experience, relying entirely on the soundscape to drive its narrative, game play and action elements. For me, it's like playing a good ""Choice of... "" game (a series of choose your own adventure e-gamebooks) in that the minimalist graphics allow the player to invest in their imagination, which can bring the world more to life than some other standard games do. It also reminds me a bit of ""Unheard"", in that the player needs to focus intently on the soundscape for clues, again drawing the player further into the experience. For that alone, it's worth experiencing at least once.

The game isn't perfect, of course. The combat, while polished and enjoyable, can start to feel a bit repetitive towards the end of the game. Combat does have it's fun points, especially where you are presented new types of foes, having to listen to totally new audio cues, as well as adapt to new behaviour patterns. It's a pity that these weren't done more in the game. The bulk of combat eventually simplifies into a pattern of waiting to block, strike back, abandon combo strikes if needed to block multiple opponents, repeat. Despite the juicy options of throwing heavy strikes and casting magic, ultimately this is the dull but most effective way to proceed. There were also missed opportunities for the combat system to shine. For example, if the player could execute timed rhythm combo attacks, or precisely timed perfect blocks at the moment of an opponent's strike (in the style of Death's Gambit), that would entice and challenge players to play more skillfully and take more risks. 

Magic is, likewise, a bit lackluster. Despite how much the game emphasizes your character's skill in magic, magic basically boils down to one AoE and one critical chance modifier, both of which end up not changing the routine combat pattern at all. Again there is a missed opportunity here to do creative stuff like raise a rock wall to protect one side (a character was shown to be able to bring down a mountain avalanche), cast darkness or blinding light (so that, as a seasoned blind fighter, you gain a huge upper hand as your opponents flail blindly), an adrenaline rush type skill to remove endurance drain, or some kind of super sensory focus to filter out distracting background noises (the chaos of the soundscape in a full on melee fight between armies at the end part of the game was terrifying and exhilarating at the same time). These are merely ideas that feed directly into the game's combat system, and already they are much more varied than what the game has.

Story-wise, the game is ok. This is more of an audio book and less of an RPG, in that there are very few times you get to make a decision in the game, and these decisions basically boil down to taking path A over B, with the only consequence being fighting different groups of enemies. The story doesn't change. There's also no time limit or consequences to side quests, so the logical thing to do is to take on all side quests. It would have been nice to have certain side quests conflict with each other, or have lasting tangible consequences. Over time you stop paying attention to your companion's pleas to think about your own safety too, which doesn't help with story immersion.

Despite these imperfections, the game is great to experience at least once, and still highly recommended!",TRUE,0,2023-09-25 15:34:44

I found this a perfect fit for the Steam Deck with good bluetooth ear buds, and I played it at night either in a dark room or in bed, like an interactive audio book. I always kept my eyes shut, imagining the scenes around me, which are quite varied and immerse you in 3D sound.... well, 2D I guess since I don't think there's much above and below you, but plenty in front, left, right etc., and with a lot of fun side quests.

Combat is interesting and a bit overwhelming; I was fine against one enemy but had to mostly dial it down to [b]casual[/b] (""[i]how embarrassing! I play Sniper Elite 5 on authentic[/i]"") after losing the multi-enemy fights about twenty times each on [b]normal[/b] difficulty.

Other than some simple ""where should we go"" style choices, you are also in charge of what weapon, shield, and armor you wear. There are honest tradeoffs here: will you be a slow, heavily armored fighter who bashes through everything? Will you be a lightly armed flash who sneaks about and attacks with speed? The story won't change very much from playthrough to playthrough, but your choices do effect the style of combat you take, the risks you take, and some of the interactions you have.

The story, while pretty simple was enjoyable, and the gameplay was fun.

The game is entirely in first person, and works by sections: you travel to a village and have stealth/combat/story moments during this travel.
Then you arrive to a village, and have a number of sidequests to do and equipment to buy.

There are two different gameplay sequences:
- The ones where you are moving your character while locating yourself with sound cues, these can be stealth sections, more action oriented, or when you are moving around in a village
- The ones where you are fighting, you will have to fight using your ears in front/on the left/on the right. Your character doesn't move during these sections and everything is done with the two sticks (on xbox controller).

A few critics:
- It didn't happen often, but there was two times where the auto-save system made me miss side-quests because I didn't understand it would make the game go to the next ""chapter"". Most of the time you can cancel a side-quest and go back to it later.

It took me about 6 hours to play through and I tried to play through all quests but I must have missed some since I didn't get the award.

If this is your first audio game and you are on the fence I recommend to try out the demo. That's what I did. Would've been nice if the save from the demo was carried over to the full game, but I can't really complain since most games out there on Steam don't even have demos.

I picked this up because I thought it was an interesting gimmick but now I'm just well-satisfied having played such a cool, unique, and well made game.

891,english,"This is a welcome, little, audio-only adventure RPG, even if a little underdeveloped and not reaching its full potential. I still recommend playing it just for the very rare experience of a well made audio-only game. 8/10. Add a point if you're visually impaired...

The combat is quite simplistic. You're just waiting for the right audio cue and rely on quick reflexes to press the correct button, but it's working and frankly is a quite refreshing change. Given the short game length of < 10 hrs it doesn't have much chance to get tiring, but also doesn't have enough depth to sustain a longer title. You have a little bit of freedom roaming through village centers following audio cues to points of interest. Unfortunately, it all seems to be awfully similar and predictable nearing the end of the game. The Vale features a very bare-bones equipment&gear system, in which you can buy better weapons and armor, but if I'm being honest it's very superficial and doesn't add much to the experience.

While the game has a couple of twists, there's nothing groundbreaking waiting for you. Expect a little bit of medieval fantasy with an underdeveloped lore of a ""Fey realm"" squabbles. Some side quests feel tacked on - living up to their name, not having much consequence on the world or having a lot of exposition. That's the price you pay for playing an RPG game with such a short playtime.
You don't have any dialogue trees in this game, however you may still be grasping at straws if your English is not very good, as the characters speak in very strong accents making it sometimes hard to decipher what are they saying.

The sound of water rushing, the way chainmetal rubs against itself as its owner moves, music of the tavern growing warmer with every step you take. Put on a sleeping mask or a blindfold, and you can feel yourself inside this sightless world.

But this would've worn its welcome if not for the game's engaging story, and it kept excited to discover what lies ahead, completely integrating the protagonists's blindness into the narrative, and doesn't overstay it's welcome.

1102,english,"[i]This review contains minor spoilers, such as when you receive certain abilities.[/i]

Superbly unique in concept, [i]The Vale: Shadow of the Crown[/i] stood out to me as a very interesting title. I was so intrigued and curious, in fact, that I ended up buying the game, installing it, and started playing it all in the very same evening. As someone who's normally got an exceedingly long process from discovery of a title to sitting down and playing it, this is unheard of. 

Happily, I was not let down. It was interesting to explore how this type of game differs from more typical games, as well as how playing video games might be experienced by sight-impaired individuals. I almost exclusively played through the game wearing a blindfold, although that is not necessary.

Gameplay-wise, the controls can take some time to get used to, but feel satisfying once one pulls them off. The difficulty is too uneven, especially comparing early and late game (I played on normal), spiking somewhere along the way. The different types of weapons seem at first to suggest that experimenting with different combat strategies is encouraged, but the actual fights one ends up in often require one strategy over any other, and so there is little room for experimentation in practice. In several towns the smith has also only got one weapon for sale, further locking one out from experimentation. The magic mechanic seems largely pointless: you unlock the ability not long before the end, and so there are few opportunities to use it, explore it, and level it up. (I don't know the extent to which any of these things apply to any of the other difficulties than normal.)

At times it was difficult to keep up with what was going on, making me confused as to what was happening, or had just happened. For example, at one point I had to infer after the fact that someone had probably succumbed in the confrontation I had just lived through. It could very well be argued that this is just how it is for people who rely in most part on their hearing for outside information, however.

The story seems simple at first, but is nevertheless enjoyable. However, it abruptly gets rather involving towards the end, and I couldn't help but feel more invested. It would've been nice to have that happen earlier, and not shortly before it is all over.

The sound design is magnificent, though it needs to be for this kind of game to work well. Paired with the nice voice work and 3D audio, it certainly makes for an immersive world, which has a massive impact on the enjoyment of a game like this.

What I enjoyed perhaps most of all was learning to take in information to make my decisions based on sound, instead of sight, by relying on audio cues to determine where the enemy is, and how they will attack. That certainly makes for a positively unique experience, and I am sure to come back for more.

This Game had me crying, the mechanics are amazing, the fighting works well (even with bad headphones) and the story had me feel all emotions, happyness, anger, sadness etc..
I tried to guess what the story is about from what you hear in the first part, i tried to guess plotpoints, I could only guess 1 of many parts in the story. The story is easy to follow and just a masterpice with trust and decision making.
This game will have a place in my heart for sure, I only wish you would hear a bit more of what happens at the end, to your friends, the citys and the people you helped.

386,english,"The Vale was one of the best RPGs I have played in recent memory. Its unique style of replacing visuals with a purely sound-based experience is extremely refreshing in an ocean of other titles which follow the same formula time and again. 

In terms of mechanics, the use of directional sound has you sneaking past enemies, aiming a bow towards the source of a noise, and blocking and trading blows with enemies from different directions. You learn to listen out for the creak of armour as an enemy changes position, the rush of footsteps as they charge towards you, arrows whistling through the air towards you. It truly is an experience like no other. For these systems to work the best it is highly recommended to use a quality pair of headphones so you can get a full sense of the directional sound, and a controller makes combat thoroughly enjoyable and gripping.

These systems are carried through by a strong narrative and decent world building, with characters showing satisfying depth and quality through stellar voice acting. In short, just get the dang game :P",TRUE,0,2022-01-10 21:42:27

This game is actually quite incredible. The story and voice acting is amazing, and I found myself drawn in from the very beginning. The biggest surprise came from the fact that the gameplay was actually very fun! I enjoyed myself from start to finish. There's a very reasonable learning curve, and it was never too difficult (or too easy) thanks to just the right amount of tutorial sprinkled throughout what was going on.

The plot was intriguing, and it kept developing the further I went along. The characters are all unique and grow on you over time and make you care. Even the side quests never feel dull or like a waste of time.

I used a sleep mask over my eyes and played with headphones and a controller, and the immersion was completely worth it.

310,english,"This was a really unique experience and thoughtfully designed around its concept. The voice acting and sound design are top notch as you might hope for in an audio-centered game. The script is very well written and, as someone not super into the fantasy genre, engaging and memorable without becoming overwhelmingly trope-y and the length feels just right. 

The quests, tutorials, and dialogue scenes are thoughtfully cut into short segments and the gameplay is kept simple in all regards, almost too simple at times although it would likely become confusing with much more going on (and in a few scenes it can overload you a bit with audio information). Combat is basically a slightly more complex whack-a-mole but it is quite impressive that it works as well as it does.

I find this to be a nice compliment to a game like Return of the Obra Dinn that is also about listening carefully but in a more puzzle focused way, in contrast to the action adventure focus in this, and while Obra Dinn has a distinct visual style as well, this offers a complete immersive audio experience that by the end had really engaged my imagination in a way I've not experienced in a game before (but have in narrative podcasts).",TRUE,0,2022-01-02 04:02:17

75,english,"Pros: A wholly unique video game experience that is playable entirely without the need of vision. Great voice acting and sound effects all around. I am very interested in Radio Theater and this game is fascinating as a concept.
The Vale is also surprisingly strong narratively, and the choice to make the main character blind makes perfect sense. A lot of the audio devices/narrative tricks used to describe flashbacks, and death/respawns are really smart. Example: If she dies in battle, it sounds like she passes out, only to wake up suddenly, saying she had a premonition of the threat ahead (it was only a dream when she died), and the game then offers you a choice to try that again or go a different way, because of your foreknowledge.

Cons: The gameplay is fairly limited, due to the constraints of the medium. At its best, it feels like a proof of concept of what could be an entire genre of games. 
If something like Oculus Rift were leveraged, it would greatly improve the game by allowing you to turn your head towards sounds and swing your arms. The greatest weakness of The Vale is that stereo sound can only offer so much, and the developers chose to only present sounds in front of and to either side of the player, never behind (because behind sound exactly like in front). Even so, what the game manages to offer is surprisingly engaging considering it is entirely audio based. This is an rpg complete with movement, combat, and equipment management all done without any visuals at all. All menus can also be navigated without sight.

576,english,"This is a very unique title and I will start this review by applauding the concept!
If more games like this gets developed and expanded upon, I'll be slightly less panicked by the thought of loosing my sight one day..

But I think there are things to improve on:

I feel like the difficulty is too low at first; those super slow charge-up roars, like every enemy is doing a Frostie's commercial, it felt almost condescending. Of course, later on, when a thousand things are happening at once, they're a welcome variety, but I feel like they should learn pretty quickly to not use such an over-telegraphed attack? But maybe that's just a necessary narrative compromise for the game to exist, like the fact that we're never attacked from behind...
But I'm not blind, so I've been playing all these other games with a variety of telegraphing-difficulty - so I don't know that it's a fair comparison against a blind person, whom I assume this game is meant for??
I just feel like the sound design could be made sharper, I guess. More distinct sounds and less clutter.

I'm really glad I'm not blind though, when purchasing items in this game! Going through the stats on gear, with my eyes closed, is a merciless process at first, trying to remember all the details..
I also find it tedious to listen to the narrator's help comments every time I need to choose quests or being told how to accept whatever, using my spacebar - being blind is not equal to being imbecile, I CAN remember simple functions. So maybe wait a little longer before reminding me of the same mechanics, over and over again? Or establish a help button to press when needed. I mean, when speech and sound are the only things the player relies on, maybe avoid wearing me down with them..
On the other hand, if I zoned out during a side-quest briefing, I'm screwed, since there's no way to have them repeat the issue at hand..

The baker fight was super difficult, mainly because the kid does this fireball combo from each side in very quick succession (how that works, I've no clue! I can clearly hear him growl to my far right, how does he hit my left side, without moving??), which, in order to block, you have to know that the shield actually lingers in a position even though you've started blocking the other direction. This took me many attempts to figure out, since there's no lesson to be taught about it. I really feel like it's a bullshit mechanic, compared to the rest of the game!

Some narrative stuff; Shepherd being pessimistic about every side-quest I wanna do, felt kinda bad. The achievements completely disagrees with him, at least, and even though the story might have a reason for him to have been like this in the end, I feel like I have to decide against the narrative to explore and see everything the game offers. It rubbed me the wrong way..
I think it's awkward if games like this can only be about the player character being blind. It's an obvious story, and they handled it well, but I'm sure this doesn't have to be the case in a game like this. - just a thought..

Last little thing; I didn't care for the pop-piano filler in the beginning - it felt really out of place compared to the rest of the soundtrack.",TRUE,2,2021-10-30 14:59:09

The gameplay is varied and in depth, there is more than combat and combat itself is nuanced and tactical.

944,english,"I'm a long time gamer and someone who has seen pretty much everything when it comes to RPGs so imagine my surprise when I found something that offers a unique gaming experience! While this is an RPG, it's also in a category of its own in terms of mechanics and that's hard to do in this day and age.

Whether you're blind or sighted the game has a lot to offer, it tests your ability to perceive the world through sound alone (use a headset!) Your success of failure depends on your ability to recognise the direction and distance of different sounds and respond accordingly.

The story line is compelling and while it may not be up there with the giants of the RPG industry, it's strong and enhanced by quality voice acting. I care about the main character and feel connected to the companions. The story also has a way of teaching you the mechanics of the game without the need for a tutorial which is really nice.

The management / customisation / inventory side of things is basic but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

I'd be happy to see more games in this genre, it certainly feels like there's a lot of potential in this style of RPG.",TRUE,8,2021-08-21 19:18:38

Sidenote(2)- We need more of these games.

Also, some extra details on gameplay (this'll be a long one, so just play the game! why are you still here?!): the game is (at least) 3-4 hours long for a run-thru, and it's fairly replay-able. There are things you won't find in one run alone, but by the end of the first run you are going to want to set the game to ""hard mode"" for a challenge (or if you want to gloat to everyone and anyone like me).

Result is that the combat experience become horrible as **** in the late game....Because in this game player use sound to track the enemy attack then respond(arrow, heavy/light attack), so in the late game, if you having multiple enemies around you doing different combo attack, the game-play is a mess, all you can hear is a mixture of sounds coming from every direction

347,english,"The Vale: Shadow of the Crown is a groundbreaking audio game that sets a new standard for interactive storytelling, especially for the blind community. As a visually impaired gamer, I was immediately drawn into the immersive world of The Vale, where the story of Alexandra Denholm unfolds with a richness and depth that is rarely seen, or rather, heard in gaming.

The game's narrative is compelling and deeply personal, resonating with me on many levels. Alexandra Denholm's journey is one of courage, resilience, and discovery, and it was a joy to experience her story. The interaction feels so natural and intuitive that I was completely engrossed, making choices and navigating through the game world with ease.

One of the standout aspects of The Vale is the character of Abdul Rashid, also known as Shepherd. Shepherd is not just a guide; he is a mentor, a protector, and a friend to Alexandra. His wisdom and experience provide Alexandra with the strength and knowledge she needs to navigate her perilous journey. Shepherd’s calm and reassuring presence is a constant source of support, and his deep, resonant voice adds a layer of authenticity to his character. Through his eyes, Alexandra—and by extension, the player—learns to ""see"" the world in a new way, relying on sounds, smells, and tactile sensations.

Shepherd's backstory and his own journey parallel Alexandra's in many ways. He, too, has faced loss and adversity, and his journey of redemption and service adds depth to his character. The dynamic between Shepherd and Alexandra is beautifully crafted, with moments of tension, humor, and heartfelt connection. Their relationship evolves naturally over the course of the game, from one of necessity to genuine friendship and mutual respect.

Alexandra Denholm, the game's protagonist, is a character of remarkable depth and complexity. Despite her noble birth, she is thrust into a world that requires her to rely on her wits and inner strength. Alexandra's determination and bravery are inspiring, and her development throughout the game is both believable and compelling. She is not a passive character; her choices and actions drive the story forward, making her an active participant in her own fate.

The developers deserve high praise for their innovative approach and dedication to accessibility. The voice acting in The Vale is exceptional, bringing each character to life with authenticity and emotion. Every voice actor delivered a stellar performance, enhancing the overall immersion and making the story even more engaging.

In conclusion, The Vale: Shadow of the Crown is a must-play for anyone who appreciates a well-crafted story and values accessibility in gaming. It is a remarkable achievement that showcases the power of audio storytelling, and I cannot wait to see what future chapters hold for Alexandra Denholm and Shepherd. Great work to the entire development team and voice actors for creating such an unforgettable experience.",TRUE,2,2024-06-27 23:02:06

The voice acting and sound design were, as expected, top notch and worked really well in tandem with the gameplay. The design challenge of making a game for the visually impaired is something very intriguing to ponder and also makes me very aware of how fortunate I am to be in the position I'm in.

As a whole it works surprisingly well, though. The immersion achieved by just relying on your hearing in detailed soundscapes is pretty impressive. And while the story and world are standard medieval fantasy, the characters really shine through good writing and emotional performances. I really liked the concise side quest structure, offering self contained vignettes that get straight to the point and can offer variety in setting more easily due to the lack of visuals needed to build unique spaces. Another surprise was the combat system, which has an unexpected depth to it, adding new mechanics constantly throughout the 6 hour experience, while still remaining accessible and simple.

485,english,"The Vale: Shadow of the Crown, or The Vale, is an action adventure game from Falling Squirrel and Creative Bytes studios.

You play as Alex, a blind princess sent to a distant castle in her brother’s kingdom. After surviving an invading army’s surprise attack, you need to find your way back to safety while learning about the world, the war and your place in both.

The Vale is uniquely experienced only via audio. Its only visuals are particle effects indicating motion, weather, and time of day. The game even reads the menus aloud, presumably allowing people with visual disabilities to enjoy the game without aid.

Much of The Vale relies on the player deducing directions and distances using only sound. For example, enemy combatants telegraph upcoming attacks with yells, allowing you to raise a shield or time counterattacks in that direction. Evading enemy camps may require listening for their crackling fires or banter. Good headphones help, as does enabling any 3D or directional audio enhancement. 

The Vale executes well. Most challenges are intuitive or quickly learned. You return to the challenge’s start if you fail, sometimes with a short hint. However, discerning multiple incoming attacks while using your abilities can be tricky in the more complex fights. 

Communicating setting and dialog solely via voice can be slow. However, The Vale‘s script is tight. Descriptions are vivid and concise, and I never got bored or frustrated waiting for dialog. The choices of accents and voice acting are brilliant, immediately identifying the speaker. 

The story is similarly tight and has many twists and reveals. Flashbacks teach skills and build relationships. “Flash forwards” unexpectedly show incorrect paths.

Removing visuals also awakens the player’s imagination. Like reading a novel, you wonder what characters and scenes look like based on accents and the occasional brief but lucid description.

The Vale makes you realize how visuals dominate games. Even for games that use stylized or simplified graphics, simple things like art and animation dominate the language used to describe them.

The Vale also reinforces that game accessibility is not about reducing the difficulty. Accessibility is about reimagining and redesigning game interaction and content. 

That said, The Vale is still niche. Visuals are more effective at quickly communicating information and adding emotional context than sound. Using sound for feedback means the game cannot have a soundtrack. The Vale will not dethrone any AAA games from the top sellers’ charts.

The Vale is also short, requiring about eight hours to complete, including all side quests. The game introduces ideas, uses them a few times then moves on to the next ones.

The Vale succeeds as a game, experiment and tech demo, and it will appeal to those looking for something unusual, those with visual impairments or students of game design.

Hopefully, these ideas spread and are enhanced or included in other games. Imagine the same techniques applied to imaginative, story-rich, graphics-lite games like Disco Elysium or Planescape: Torment.

In the walking part of he gameplay you orientate yourself by listening to sounds in the surrounding like merchants, water, fire or enemies talking, which in some cases you can avoid with stealth. But those parts are quite short and you will not get lost at all.

Combat consists of blocking, light/heavy attacks and counters. When fighting multiple enemies it requires some concentration and timing but it is not too hard and you can adjust the difficulty. With bow and arrow you always have enough time to aim carefully, especially in the optional hunting quests.

The equipment upgrades are quite basic but at least allow you to choose between a slow/heavy or fast/light fighting style, but don’t expect anything RPG-like here.

Standing in darkness, knowing you are surrounded by people who want to kill you, listening to the creaking of armor or the splash of water. The game manages to draw you into the moment and feel the panic.

The cast is very well written and the protagonist is a prime example of a strong female character. 

Definitely one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time and I can't recommend it enough!

Only complaint is the lack of save slots so I can show it off to my friends.",TRUE,0,2021-11-25 16:34:49

449,english,"Very highly recommend to try it out. The sound design is fantastic (as you would expect from a game which is entirely audio) and the combat is a good challenge. i found the difficulty curve very interesting, it less based on enemy health and damage and more based on quantity and amount of background noise, you start of mostly fighting 1 enemy at a time in a quiet forest but as you go you eventually end up fighting multiple enemies at once whilst listening out for arrows being fired at you all being drowned out by the sound of other nearby combat or the splashing of water. The stealth sections take on an almost horror game feel as you try and sneak between multiple patches of terrible sounds which at some points can feel like there are only centimetres away.",TRUE,0,2021-08-23 11:15:25

184,spanish,Por temas laborales no pude seguir jugando pero realmente es uno de los pocos juegos (que jugué) que está bien diseñado y tiene una buena historia. El hecho de jugar con una persona no vidente y sentir como sería una gran aventura es algo muy bien logrado.,TRUE,6,2021-11-25 13:39:41
700,spanish,"Hablar de The Vale implica abordar un juego bastante único en su género. ¿A qué género pertenece? Es difícil decirlo. A nivel jugable, podría tratarse de una aventura gráfica o de una novela narrativa, o quizá de ambos. A nivel temático, estamos ante un juego de rol, pero también de acción y aventura. ¿Y cuál es nuestro rol en todo este entramado de acciones? Lamentablemente, es una pregunta que la aventura no responde del todo por sí misma. Se trata de un vistazo, del comienzo de una aventura más grande, en cuyo centro operan fuerzas poco claras que en esta ¿primera parte? apenas conocemos.

Pero lo cierto es que, a pesar de ello, se trata de un juego formidable donde solo usaremos nuestra audición para orientarnos en un mundo a oscuras, ya que estaremos en la piel de una princesa guerrera que es, a su vez, una persona ciega. Y dicha ceguera, por supuesto, no solo no será un impedimento para el combate, sino la llave para la elaboración de un sistema de combate en el que nos guiaremos por el sonido para saber de dónde vienen nuestros atacantes, así como qué tipos de ataque van a realizar. En cada uno de esos casos, tendremos distintas acciones, como contraatacar, bloquear, anticiparnos con un ataque y hasta... mejor lo dejo para que lo descubran ustedes. De todas maneras, hay que hacer una pequeña salvedad: aunque la pantalla esté prácticamente en negro, habrá pequeñas motas de luz que se irán moviendo a medida que transcurra la aventura, las cuales nos indicarán si estamos caminando o si estamos quietos, si es de noche (motas azules) o de día (motas amarillas), etcétera. Si llueve, serán azules y caerán como cualquier lluvia de toda la vida, así que a nivel visual también tiene su encanto.

La trama, por otra parte, podría resumirse en un viaje de regreso, atravesando The Vale o El Valle, un espacio comprendido entre el punto en el que empezamos y el punto al que debemos volver (Glades, a quinientas millas de distancia), que a su vez da título al juego. En dicho viaje nos acompañará Shepperd ('pastor'), que nos llamará Sheep ('oveja') en ciertas ocasiones. Así, con la fiel compañía de este personaje y otros que nos iremos encontrando a lo largo del camino, pasaremos por pueblos llenos de vida y otros desolados en los que nos esperará una aventura a la vuelta de cada sonido.

Todo en este juego es hermoso. Pero siempre podemos encontrar algunas cositas que podrían haber estado mejor. Lo primero que lamento es que el misterio detrás de ciertos eventos importantes para la trama no se termine develando, aunque imagino que es porque habrá pensada una secuela. Lo segundo: está inglés y, debido al público al que va dirigido principalmente (personas ciegas), no tiene subtítulos. Esto hará que solo quienes entiendan inglés esuchándolo puedan comprender la trama y disfrutarla verdaderamente.

Solo queda esperar una secuela que termine de explicar por qué esas fuerzas misteriosas actúan del modo en que lo hacen. y, sobre todo, cuál va a ser nuestro verdadero rol en todo eso.",TRUE,3,2022-09-18 19:48:27
